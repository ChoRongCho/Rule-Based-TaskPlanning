In this domain, we define different types of objects and their respective actions. The `place_fragile_on_soft` action ensures that a fragile object can only be placed above a soft object if it is intact. The `fold_flexible` action allows a flexible object to be folded. The `press_deformable` action allows a deformable object to be pressed. Lastly, the `avoid_pressing_rigid` action is a placeholder to indicate that rigid objects should not be pressed and hence has no effect."
