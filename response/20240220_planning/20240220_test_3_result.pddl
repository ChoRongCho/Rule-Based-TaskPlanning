Here is a plan to pack all objects in the bin:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Initialize robot
    robot = Robot()

    # Pick and place object2 in the bin
    robot.pick(object2)
    robot.place(object2, bin1)

    # Pick and fold object3
    robot.pick(object3)
    robot.fold(object3)

    # Place folded object3 in the bin
    robot.place(object3, bin1)

    # Pick and place object1 in the bin
    robot.pick(object1)
    robot.place(object1, bin1)
```

This plan follows all the rules. It first places the soft object (object2) in the bin to protect the fragile objects. Then it folds the foldable object (object3) and places it in the bin. Finally, it places the rigid object (object1) in the bin.
