--Predicate Prompt--
Hi, my name is UR5, and I am a robot. 
Our goal is to pack a set of objects into a box, which is called bin packing. In a problem instance, there is a box, a manipulator robot(it's me!), and objects set. 
We want to consider physical properties of the objects such as flexible, rigid, soft, and fragile. 
Given this goal, I want to make a domain.pddl considering the physical properties of the objects. The domain file is supposed to include predicates such as is_flexible. Actions must consider the predicates in preconditions and effects. 


--Instruction Prompt--
Now, I'm going to talk about precautions when doing bin packing. 
During packing the objects, I want to follow several rules. First, put a fragile object on top of a soft object to prevent breaking the fragile object.
Second, a flexible object is preferred to be folded to make it compact to secure spaces for other objects.
Third, a rigid object should not be pressed hard.
Fourth, a deformable object can be pressed if possible.
The actions I can do are push, place, pick, fold, and base. 
When you define action in domain.pddl, you must use that action set. No other actions is permitted.
