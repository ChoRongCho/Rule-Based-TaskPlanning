To solve the Hanoi task, we need to keep track of specific object attributes. These include the object's size (in the context of Hanoi, smaller discs can be placed on larger ones but not vice versa), and its current state (whether it is being held by the robot or not). Also, we need to keep track of the object's current location (which peg it is on).

Here is an example of how you can modify the Object data class:

```python
@dataclass
class Objects:
    # Basic dataclass
    index: int
    name: str
    location: str  # name of the peg it is on. Can be peg1, peg2, peg3, or None if it's being held by the robot.
    color: str or bool
    object_type: str  # disk or peg
    size: int  # smaller numbers represent smaller sizes
    is_held_by_robot: bool  # True if the object is being held by the robot, False otherwise.

# Example creation of objects
disk1 = Objects(index=1, name="disk1", location="peg1", color="red", object_type="disk", size=1, is_held_by_robot=False)
peg1 = Objects(index=8, name="peg1", location=None, color="brown", object_type="peg", size=None, is_held_by_robot=False)

# When the robot picks up an object, set is_held_by_robot to True and location to None.
# When the robot puts an object on a peg, set location to the name of the peg and is_held_by_robot to False.
```

You can add additional attributes if needed based on the specific requirements of your task.
