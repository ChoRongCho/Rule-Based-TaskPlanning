Here is the extended Objects dataclass with additional predicates necessary for a bin packing task:

```python
@dataclass
class Objects:
    # Basic dataclass
    index: int
    name: str
    location: tuple
    color: str or bool
    object_type: str

    # additional predicates for bin_packing
    is_deformable: bool = False
    is_fragile: bool = False
    is_foldable: bool = False
    in_bin: bool = False
```

In the added predicates, `is_deformable`, `is_fragile`, and `is_foldable` are boolean values indicating whether the object is deformable, fragile or foldable. The `in_bin` attribute indicates whether the object is currently in the bin.

Also, keep in mind that in your main function, you created instances of `Object` class which does not exist, it should be `Objects`. 

```python
obj1 = Objects(index=1, name="obj1", location=(10, 20), color="red", object_type="object")
obj2 = Objects(index=2, name="obj2", location=(15, 30), color="blue", object_type="object", is_deformable=True)
obj3 = Objects(index=3, name="obj3", location=(0, 10), color="red", object_type="object", is_fragile=True)
obj4 = Objects(index=4, name="obj4", location=(30, 40), color="green", object_type="object", is_foldable=True)
box = Objects(index=0, name="box", location=(20, 50), color=None, object_type="bin")
objects_list = [obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4, box]
```


                # rule
                # 0. if object.location == bin.location => the object is in {bin}
                # 1. when pick the object, the robot.handempty is True.
                # 2. when place the object, the robot.handempty is False.
                # 3. when push the object, the object is not fragile and rigid, object is deformable and robot is handempty, finally, {object} in {bin}
                # 4. when place the object which is fragile, after the deformable objects is placed in the bin.
                # 5. when out the object, the robot.handempty is True
