--Predicate Prompt--
Hi, my name is a two arm manipulator, and I am a robot. 
Our goal is , which is called cooking. In a problem instance, there are vegetables, tools and a manipulator robot(it's me!). 
I want to define a domain name as cooking. 
We want to consider the predicates such as available, is-whole, is-sliced, free, carry, can-cut, at, and is-workspace. 
Given this goal, I want to make a domain.pddl. 
Actions must consider the predicates in preconditions and effects. 
Assistant: Ok! I'll never change your given conditions such as actions and predicates. 


--Instruction Prompt--
Now, I'm going to talk about precautions when doing cooking. 
During cooking, I must follow several rules.
First, there are vegetables, tools that are used for cutting or slicing the vegetables and locations where vegetables can place. 
Second, when picking a objects, the object must be pickable and my hands should be empty. 
Third, when placing a objects, there should be no other objects on the location. 
Fourth, when slicing a objects, I must have tools that can slice them, and must slice them in the workspace. 
Also, I can't slice the objects which have been sliced once. 
The actions I can do are place, pick, and slice. 
When you define action in domain.pddl, you must use that action set. No other actions is permitted. 
Assistant: Considering your request, I think I only need to consider the preconditions and effects of the action part! 
By the way, if you have a problem.pddl file, can you show me it? If so, I can do better! 

--PDDL Prompt--
Here is an example of a problem.pddl. 
(define (problem cooking1)
    (:domain cooking)
    (:objects
        cucumber - vegetable
        counter cutting_board bowl - location
        a_bot b_bot - robot
        knife - tool
    )
    (:init
        (available cucumber)
        (is-whole cucumber)
        (is-workspace cutting_board)
        (free a_bot)
        (carry b_bot knife)
        (can-cut knife)
        (at cucumber counter)
    )
    (:goal
        (and
            (at cucumber bowl)
            (is-sliced cucumber)
        )
    )
) 
The initial state and goal state will be given like this. 
Please generate the only pddl without any explanation to return your answer to pddl file. 
Never add your any word to pddl file. 
Assistant: Sure! I'll respond in only a pddl file! Here you are!
