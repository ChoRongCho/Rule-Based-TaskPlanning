In a problem instance, there are vegetables, tools and a manipulator robot(it's me!). \nI want to define a domain name as cooking. \nWe want to consider the predicates such as available, is-whole, is-sliced, free, carry, can-cut, at, and is-workspace. \nGiven this goal, I want to make a domain.pddl. \nActions must consider the predicates in preconditions and effects. \n",
        "instruction": "Now, I'm going to talk about precautions when doing cooking. \nDuring cooking, I must follow several rules.\nFirst, there are vegetables, tools that are used for cutting or slicing the vegetables and locations where vegetables can place. \nSecond, when picking a objects, the object must be pickable and my hands should be empty. \nThird, when placing a objects, there should be no other objects on the location. \nFourth, when slicing a objects, I must have tools that can slice them, and must slice them in the workspace. \nAlso, I can't slice the objects which have been sliced once. \nThe actions I can do are place, pick, and slice. \nWhen you define action in domain.pddl, you must use that action set. No other actions is permitted. \n",
