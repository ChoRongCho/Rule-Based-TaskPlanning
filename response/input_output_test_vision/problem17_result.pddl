In the image, there are two objects outside of the box and one empty white box which is likely the bin for the bin_packing task. The objects outside the box include a yellow sponge and a stack of black items that could be some sort of spacers or connectors. The white box appears to be made of cardboard and has side walls with slots, possibly for assembling or securing the packed items.
