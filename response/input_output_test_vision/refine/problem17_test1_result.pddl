In the image, there are a few objects and a box which are likely part of the bin_packing task you mentioned. Here's what is visible:

- A yellow sponge-like object.
- A black rectangular object.
- A white box, which seems to be the bin into which the objects are to be packed.

These items are placed on a flat surface, and the task involves packing the objects into the box efficiently.
