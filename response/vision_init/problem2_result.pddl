In the image, there are three items on a table:

1. A blue lanyard: It appears to have a metal clip at one end, which is typically used to hold identification cards, keys, or other small items.

2. A white paper napkin or tissue: It is square-shaped and looks like it could be used for cleaning or wiping surfaces.

3. An empty white box: This box has vertical slots on the sides, which might be used for inserting dividers or for some sort of organization. It looks like it's made of a sturdy material, perhaps plastic, and it's open at the top, ready to be packed with items.

These items might be part of the materials you are using for a bin packing task.
