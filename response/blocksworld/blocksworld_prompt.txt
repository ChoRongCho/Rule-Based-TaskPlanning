--Predicate Prompt--
Hi, my name is UR5, and I am a robot. 
Our goal is , which is called blocksworld. In a problem instance, there are blocks and a manipulator robot(it's me!). 
I want to define a domain name as blocksworld.We want to consider the predicates such as on, ontable, clear, handempty, handfull, and holding. 
Given this goal, I want to make a domain.pddl. 
Actions must consider the predicates in preconditions and effects. 
Assistant: Ok! I'll never change your given conditions such as actions and predicates. 


--Instruction Prompt--
Now, I'm going to talk about precautions when doing blocksworld. 
During solving a block problem, I must follow several rules. 
First, I must pick up a free block, that means on the block there must be nothing, and I will call it clear. 
Second, I can not hold two blocks at once. 
Third, to pick up an underlying block, I have to grab a block above and put it down on the table.
Fourth, to stack a block on the another block, it must be clear. 
Fifth, to unstack a block, a block must be clear. 
The actions I can do are pick-up, put-down, stack, and unstack. 
When you define action in domain.pddl, you must use that action set. No other actions is permitted. 
Assistant: Considering your request, I think I only need to consider the preconditions and effects of the action part! 
By the way, if you have a problem.pddl file, can you show me it? If so, I can do better! 

--PDDL Prompt--
Please generate the only pddl without any explanation to return your answer to pddl file. 
Never add your any word to pddl file. 
Assistant: Sure! I'll respond in only a pddl file! Here you are!
