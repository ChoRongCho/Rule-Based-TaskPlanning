Sure, here is an example of how you can extend the dataclass to include additional predicates that may be useful for bin packing:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Object:
    # Basic dataclass
    index: int
    name: str
    location: tuple
    size: tuple
    color: str or bool
    object_type: str

    # Object physical properties predicates
    is_rigid: bool
    is_flexible: bool
    is_foldable: bool

    # bin_packing Predicates (max 3)
    is_in_bin: bool
    is_on_top: bool
    is_on_bottom: bool

    # Additional predicates
    is_heavy: bool
    is_fragile: bool
    is_stackable: bool
    is_rotatable: bool
```

In this example, I've added several new predicates:

- `is_heavy`: This could be useful for determining the order in which objects should be packed (heavier objects might need to go on the bottom).
- `is_fragile`: This could be useful for determining where an object should be placed in the bin (fragile objects might need extra protection).
- `is_stackable`: This could be useful for determining whether other objects can be placed on top of this one.
- `is_rotatable`: This could be useful for determining whether the object can be rotated to fit better in the bin.
