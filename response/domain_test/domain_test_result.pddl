The task of bin packing can be divided into two types of objects: 

1. Items to be packed (Target Objects): These are the objects that need to be packed into the bin. They include obj1, obj2, obj3, and obj4.

2. Resources used for packing (Operational Objects): These are the objects used to facilitate the packing process. They include the bin (which is the package where all objects are placed) and the robot_hand (which is the tool used to move and pack the objects). 

It's essential to note that in different contexts, the classification may vary. For instance, if the task is to pack multiple bins into a larger container, then the bins would also be considered target objects.
